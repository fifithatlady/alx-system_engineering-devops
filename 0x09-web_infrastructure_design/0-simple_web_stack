### Simplified Explanation:

**Domain Name:** 
- A domain name like www.foobar.com is the user-friendly name for a website, making it easy to remember compared to the complex IP address (e.g., 127.345.456.4).

**DNS (Domain Name System):**
- The DNS system is like a phone book for the internet, translating domain names into IP addresses. For example, www.foobar.com points to foobar.com, which, in turn, points to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

**Server:**
- A server (like 8.8.8.8) is a powerful computer storing a website's data. It serves this data to users' computers when they request it.

**HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):**
- HTTP is the communication method that enables the transfer of webpage information between a user's browser and the web server.

**Web Server:**
- A web server sends pre-stored webpage files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to the user's browser for display.

**Application Server:**
- An application server provides additional website services, including dynamic features like data uploads and updates.

**Database:**
- A database stores and manages data, structuring it for organizations and users. It's used in conjunction with the application server to create various services.

**Design Issues:**
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If a server fails, the entire system can fail. To prevent this, redundancy with a second server is necessary.
- **Downtime:** Maintenance or server issues can cause downtime, making the website temporarily unavailable. 
- **Scalability:** A single server can struggle during high traffic. Adding a second server helps share the load and maintain performance.
