# Postmortem: Web_01 Access Troubles

On an otherwise uneventful day, my trusty server, Web_01, decided to play an unexpected game of hide and seek, leaving me—the only player in this digital quest—puzzled with a persistent 404 error. It seemed as though Web_01 had made itself completely invisible to my queries.

The digital mystery unfolded around 12:00 PM local time (UTC+2), precisely when I noticed something was amiss. Web_01 had stopped responding as it usually did. Taking on the role of a server-side detective, I delved into its configuration files at 12:05 PM, suspecting a potential bad hair day on the server's part.

As I continued my investigation at 12:20 PM, a thought crossed my mind: perhaps Web_01 was feeling a bit anti-social today. A quick check of its network settings revealed signs of introverted behavior. However, my attempt to engage with Web_01 using a digital 'ping' at 12:40 PM met with silence—something fishy was indeed going on.

Realizing this was a more significant issue, I donned multiple hats—playing the roles of a network engineer, system administrator, and even Web_01's creator—at 1:00 PM. The revelation came at 1:15 PM: Web_01 was being a loner due to a network switch misconfiguration, akin to not letting it out of its digital room.

Swiftly at 1:30 PM, I fixed the settings, liberating Web_01 from its self-imposed digital isolation and restoring order to the server world.

Reflecting on this digital escapade, it became clear that Web_01, in its shy demeanor, had isolated itself due to a misconfiguration in the network switch settings, akin to preventing it from mingling with the rest of the servers.

The resolution was straightforward—fixing the network switch settings to allow Web_01 to join the digital party again and respond to requests. However, to prevent a recurrence of this lone adventure, I realized the importance of regular check-ins with Web_01, keeping an attentive eye on its network behavior, and establishing a communication strategy for future 'talks' to avoid silent episodes.

As a takeaway, I documented the incident to ensure lessons were learned for the next unexpected digital escapade. I committed to scrutinizing all network settings, fortifying Web_01 against potential solo adventures, and took the initiative to educate the team on handling such situations in my absence.

In the digital world of Web_01, this server escapade reminded me that even servers need a bit of socializing in the vast network playground. You can catch the full story on our GitHub repository, where every server's journey is a tale worth sharing.
